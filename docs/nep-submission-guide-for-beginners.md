This guide is for those unfamiliar with the NEP Review Process and provides simple instructions for BEP submission, update, and request for final. This guide won't cover complex NEP status change and other requests described in NEPs Guideline.

## Start A NEP

You can start writing your thoughts of a NEP first. And check if your thoughts are already in the existing NEPs.

You can choose from the NEP templates to get started. Since you already wrote down your thoughts, try to use a template from and finish the Summary and Abstract section. If your thoughts are not formed well enough, you can choose to skip the templates and use it later.

Discussion with other people, try to get one or more people become your co-authors, that helps your NEP become more carefully considered. Also it is recommended to have a public discussion board from the beginning. You can choose any public discussion services such as Google Groups, Facebook Pages, or your own Github repos.

You can choose any text editor apps to work with. If you are more familiar with Google Docs, Apple Pages, Microsoft Word, it is okay to use them to begin with. But the formal NEP for submission requires a Mark Down format. You will need to use a NEP template later.

## To Submit NEP for The First Time

All NEP submissions require to make a Pull Request(PR) from your own git repository on Github. If you haven't forked the NEPs repository, please fork the repository before submission.

Make sure your NEP documents and assets follow the NEPs guideline. All NEPs submission not following the guideline require may get rejected.

### Create Pull Request for NEP submission

- State clear you are submitting the NEP for the first time in the title.
- Make sure to check **Allow edits from maintainers**

### NEP Editor Review

- NEP Editors will review your submission.
- If your NEP requires modifications, NEP Editors will point out and ask you to make changes in your repository.
- If the NEP editor thinks your NEP is ready for the Review Board to review. A NEP Editor will assign a NEP number and update your documents. You can not add/change your NEP number by yourself. If you self added/changed the NEP number. The submission will be rejected.

### NEP Board Review

- The NEP Review Board host meetings for NEP review regularly.
- The Authors may be invited to join the meeting depending on the type or contents of your NEP.
- If your NEP passed the review. Your NEP submission will pass and NEP Editors will include(merge) your NEP to Newton's NEPs Repository.
- If your NEP is good but require small changes like description, content naming space, add references to support your NEP. You should update your NEP documents. Once you have completed the change, add a reply to your PR and mention a NEP Editor to review your change. Once reviewed and the NEP Editor thinks it meets all the questions/problems from the Review Board. The NEP Editor will pass your NEP without additional review from the NEP Review Board, the NEP Editor will include(merge) your NEP to Newton's NEPs Repository.
- If the NEP Review Board thinks the NEP will not pass. Your submission will be rejected. And the PR will be closed. If you wish to continue on the same NEP, you can make a new PR in the future.
- As long as your new NEP PR is talking about the same thing and you kept NEP number assigned history from the NEP Editor in your repository. You can use the same NEP number in your future submission.

## To Update a Draft NEP

**You have to be one of the Author to update a NEP***

To update a Draft NEP, you must be one of the Authors mentioned in the NEP. If you are not amount the authors, your submission will be rejected. Contact the NEP Authors you are willing to join and ask them to add you to the NEP first.

If you tried contact the Authors and get no response, you may ask the NEP Editors for assistance. If the NEP Editors can't reach the NEP Authors, the editor may consider they have abandoned the NEP and change the status to abandoned. You may work on that and submit new updates to that NEP.

**Only NEP in Active/Draft status can accept updates***

Once a NEP become Final. It can no longer accept changes.

An Active status NEP can accept updates for adding features, but other parts can not be changes.
