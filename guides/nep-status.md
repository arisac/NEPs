## II. Status Definations

Each status change is requested by the NEP author and reviewed by the NEP editors. Use a pull request to update the status. Please include a link to where people should continue discussing your NEP. The NEP editors will process these requests as per the conditions below.

### 1. WIP(Work In Progress)

**WIP**: Work In Progress is the status before a NEP is submitted to Newton for review. The champion can use other status name such as an _IDEA_ to share the NEP for discussion outside Newton's Github repository.

#### `WIP` --> `Draft`

- Once the champion has finished a NEP and consider it's ready to be merged to Newton's Github repository. they will write a draft NEP as a **pull request**. Consider including an implementation if this will aid people in studying the NEP.

### 2. Draft

**Draft**: If the draft is agreeable amount the Newton community, NEP editor will assign the NEP a number (generally the issue or PR number related to the NEP) and merge your pull request. The NEP editor will not unreasonably deny an NEP.

#### `Draft` -> update `Draft`

- Once the first draft has been merged, you may submit follow-up pull requests with further changes to your draft until such point as you believe the NEP to be mature and ready to proceed to the next status.

#### `Draft` -> `Public Call`

- ✅: If agreeable, the NEP editor will assign `Public Call` status and set a review end date (_review-period-end_), normally 14 days later.

- ❌ -> `Draft`: A request for `Public Call` status will be denied if material changes are still expected to be made to the `Draft`. We hope that NEPs only enter `Public Call` once, so as to avoid unnecessary resource.

#### `Draft` -> `Rejected`

- See `Rejected` status.

#### `Draft` -> `Abandoned`

- See `Abandoned` status.

### 3. Public Call

**Public Call**: This NEP will listed prominently on the https://newtonproject.org/nep website.

#### `Public Call` -> `Active` / `Final`

- ✅: A successful `Public Call` without material changes or unaddressed technical complaints will become Final.

- ❌ -> `Draft`: A `Public Call` which results in material changes or substantial unaddressed technical complaints will cause the NEP to revert to `Draft`.

### 4. Final

**Final**: This NEP represents the current state-of-the-art. A `Final` NEP should only be updated to correct errata.

#### `Final` -> `Implemented`

- See `Implemented` status.

#### `Final` -> `Deferred`

- See `Deferred` status.

#### `Final` -> `Superseded`

- See `Superseded` status.

### 5. Implemented

**Implemented**: Some NEP is required one-time only implementation to meets the NEP's to be completed. Once the implementation is complete, the status will be changed to "Implemented" by an editor. Only NEPs with status `Final` can be changed to `Implemented`.

#### `Implemented` -> `Superseded`

- See `Superseded` status.

### 6. Deferred

**Deferred**: An NEP with plan to be `Implemented` will become `Deferred` if haven't met the criteria to be marked as `Implemented`.

### 7. Superseded

**Superseded**: An NEP which was previously `Final` but is no longer considered state-of-the-art. Another NEP will be in `Final` status and reference the `Superseded` NEP. An NEP cannot move on from this state.

### 8. Active

**Active**: Some Informational and Process NEP may also have a status of `Active` if they are never meant to be completed.

### 9. Abandoned

**Abandoned**: This NEP is no longer pursued by the original authors or it may not be a preferred option anymore.

#### `Abandoned` -> `Draft`

- Authors or new champions wishing to pursue this NEP can ask for changing it to `Draft` status.

### 10. Rejected

**Rejected**: An NEP that is fundamentally broken. An NEP cannot move on from this state.
