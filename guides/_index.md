## What Is NEP

Newton Evolution Proposal (NEP) describes Proposals for the Newton Project including _Economic Model_, _Personnel_, _Technical_, _Community Governance_ and _Business_.

Read [NEP-0: NEP Genesis](../NEPS/nep-0/index.md) for more.

## Parties Involved In A NEP

Parties involved in the process a NEP are:

- You, the Champion or NEP Author(s)
- [NEP editors](nep-editors.md)
- [NEP Review Board](nep-review-board.md)
- and the Public Communnity

## Start A NEP

We welcome anyone with suggestions related to Newton Project to compile a NEP.

Before you begin writing a formal NEP, you should vet your idea. Ask the Newton community first if an idea is original to avoid wasting time on something that will be be rejected based on prior research.

In addition to making sure your idea is original, it will be your role as the author to make your idea clear to reviewers and interested parties, as well as inviting editors, developers and community to give feedback. You should try and gauge whether the interest in your NEP is commensurate with both the work involved in implementing it and how many parties will have to conform to it. Negative community feedback will be taken into consideration and may prevent your NEP from moving past the Draft stage.

```
[ WIP ] -> [ DRAFT ] -> [ PUBLIC CALL ] -> [ FINAL / ACTIVE ]
```
