This document will cover:

- NEP Document Directory
- NEP Templates
- NEP Header Preamble
- NEP Content Format

## I. NEP Document Directory

```js (just using the syntax highlight)
// NEPs Document Directory
./
└─ NEPS/
|  └─ nep-x/           // `x` is the NEP Number
|  |  ├─ index.md      // main NEP Document in English
|  |  ├─ index.zh.md   // main NEP Document in Chinese
|  |  ├─ image1.png    // image used in NEP
|  |  ├─ image2.jpg    // image used in NEP
|  |  └─ filename.ext  // file used in NEP
|  └─ nep-template/    // this is the NEP Template Folder
```

### NEP Document File

NEP Doument file is `index.md` file in it's directory.

Every NEP should starts with the English version first. Each translation is translated from that English and placed in a new file using `index.lang.md` format.

### Auxiliary Files

If your NEP requires images, the image files should be included in the same directory of that NEP. When linking to an image in the NEP, use relative links such as `image.png`. Other files should follow the same pattern.

- When linking files from another NEP, it is enforced to copy that file from reference NEP directory to the working NEP directory.

- Files of `jpg`, `jpeg`, `png`, `svg` format are generally accepted.

- Files of `html`, `js` and other server-side or browser-side executable format are not accepted.

- If you must include an executable file like `js`, change the extension to `txt` instead.

## II. NEP Templates

```js (just using the syntax highlight)
// NEP Template Directory
./
└─ NEPS/
|  └─ nep-template/    // this is the NEP Template Folder
|  |  └─ index.md      // this is the NEP Template Document
|  └─ nep-x/           // your NEP-X Folder
|  |  └─ index.md      // your NEP-X Document
```

To use the NEP Template, copy `nep-template` folder to `nep-x` folder and start your NEP with `nep-x/index.md`.

Current available templates:

- General NEP Template `./NEPS/nep-template/`

- NEP Template for Token (NRC) `./NEPS/nep-template-nrc/`

```

- The NEP Number of NEP that _is_ or _is to be_ superseded by this NEP

Superseding:
Categories:
Types:
Created:
Updated:

# NEP Content Starts
```

## IV. NEP Content Format

NEP Content should be written in **Markdown** format. Markdown formatting is widely used in websites and documents, also there were dozens of implementations in many languages and software applications.

**CommonMark Spec** is a standard for Markdown and adopted by many applications. To see the latest **CommonMark Spec** please visit [https://spec.commonmark.org](https://spec.commonmark.org).

We'll provide more format examples in this document later.
